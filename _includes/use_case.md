## What people think

- ![](./img/Jenn.jpg) When I cracked open my first edition I felt like it had been grown in a lab just for me. The perfect digital detox. <span class="testimonial-name">Jenn, librarian.</span>
- ![](./img/ben.jpg) I take mine to a cafe, and leave my phone at home. If I take the phone it takes two hours to read, without it it takes an hour. If I try reading long articles on the Pocket app, I don't know how long it would take, I always get distracted! <span class="testimonial-name">Ben, developer.</span>
- ![](./img/julz.jpg) I read on a screen all day for work, so taking time to read on a physical zine custom curated by me makes my leisure reading really enjoyable. Great quality printing and integrates really well with my pocket. <span class="testimonial-name">Jülz, engineer.</span>
