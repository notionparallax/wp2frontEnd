      Loading your Pocket data for a graph. We love graphs but if you have a lot

      wait for it to finish before you change the sliders below.)

      Pocket has been going for a long time, so you might have articles that are
      that old too. Maybe you want to read them, but this lets you filter for
      only newer articles.

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="extra-tags">Tag includer</label>
    <p>
      The tag <code>wpmustprint</code> makes articles be prioritised for
      inclusion in your upcoming edition. If you want to add more tags that do
      this, put them in here:
    </p>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="extra-tags"
      name="extra-tags"
      placeholder="Type tags in here"
    />
    <p>
      Write them as a comma separated list, e.g.:
      <code>knitting, malt, mountain bike</code> will give you three extra tags.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="search-words">Search-term includer</label>
    <p>
      If you want to include articles with specific words in the title, put them
      in here:
    </p>
    <input
      type="text"
      id="search-words"
      name="search-words"
      placeholder="Type search terms in here"
    />
    <p>
      Write them as a comma separated list, e.g.:
      <code>car, typography, plastic bag</code> will give you articles like:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Not All Electric Vehicles Are Cars, You Know</li>
      <li>
        Are cotton totes better for the Earth than plastic bags? It depends on
        what you care about
      </li>
      <li>Rhythm in Web Typography</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But it will also give you "The secret life of Wetherspoon‚Äôs freaky
      <em>car</em>pets" because there is a car in carpets.

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="curator"
      >Curation strategy: how should we fill your edition?</label
    >
    <p>
      We use a modified Knapsack algorithm to pick articles for your edition so
      it has the right amount of content. It's the nicest way to get a variety
      of lengths and ages of articles. You can
      <a href="https://waldenpond.press/2020/09/10/curation.html"
        >read about it here</a
      >. We call it "big rock" because it make sure that you have at least one
      long article to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want your articles to come out like a plate stack, then chose LIFO
      (Last in, First Out). This takes the most recent thing that you've saved
      and puts it at the start of your edition, and so on until you've used up
      your time.
    </p>
    <select name="curation_strategy" id="curation_strategy">
      <option value="big_rock" selected="selected">Big Rock</option>
      <!-- ü™® TODO: put this rock in once it's shipped! -->
      <option value="lifo">LiFo</option>
    </select>
    <p>
      If you've picked LiFo, you probably want to pick a non-magic sorting
      strategy too.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="curator">Sorting: how should we order your articles?</label>
    <p>
      The knapsack algorithm orders the editions by magic. If you want a more
      predictable ordering, then here's your chance.
    </p>
    <select name="sorting_strategy" id="sorting_strategy">
      <option value="magic" selected="selected">Magic üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</option>
      <option value="oldest_at_the_front">Oldest at the front</option>
      <option value="newset_at_the_front">Newest at the front</option>
    </select>
    <p>
      You might want this if you're reading a series of articles, or you like to
      read news, and you don't want spoilers.
    </p>

  <div class="form-group">
    <input
      type="checkbox"

      name="show_name_on_spine"
      checked
    />
    <label for="show_name_on_spine">Your name on the spine?</label>
    <p>
      Would you like your name on the spine? We think you should&mdash;you are
      the editor of this fine volume after all&mdash;but some might like it to
      be a bit more incognito on the bookshelf.
