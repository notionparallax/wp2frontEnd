  The most recent edition is only indicative of what you'll get. If you don't
  like it, you can exclude articles with the <code>wpnoprint</code> tag in
  Pocket, or include other articles with the editorial controls on
  <a href="/home">the home page</a>.

<div id="history-container" class="history-container">
  {% include pocket_article_template.html %}
</div>

{% include base-scripts.md %}
<script src="js/history.js"></script>
<a href="new__history.html" style="opacity: 0.1">ðŸ‘»</a>
