_Walden Pond_ is a little paper zine that comes once a month in the mail ✉. It's full of a selection of the articles you've saved to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), so you know that you're interested in everything inside. Each issue has over an hour of reading, the battery will never run out, it's clear in bright sunlight 😎 and has a low-latency pen interface (or pencil) 📝.

## Pricing

You'll get a monthly edition that fits how much you read. The fancy thing to do is get us to print for you, but if you live somewhere that we don't post to, or if you have an expensive printer and a burning desire to use it, you can get a PDF copy.

{% include pricing.html %}

That's the price, no extra postage costs or mystery fees.
