_Walden Pond_ is a little paper zine that comes once a month in the mail ‚úâ. It's full of a selection of the articles you've saved to [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), so you know that you're interested in everything inside. Each issue has over an hour of reading, the battery will never run out, it's clear in bright sunlight üòé and has a low-latency pen interface (or pencil) üìù.

## Pricing

You'll get a monthly edition that fits how much you read. That's the price, no extra postage costs or mystery fees.

<!-- The fancy thing to do is get us to print for you, but if you live somewhere that we don't post to, or if you have an expensive printer and a burning desire to use it, you can get a PDF copy. -->
